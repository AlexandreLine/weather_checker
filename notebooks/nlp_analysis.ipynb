Even rarer –\\nin fact ornithologically speaking a brand-new species – the market was treated to the sight of origin buying today as a Bloomberg \\nstory winged its way across the newswires reporting the possibility of an Ivorian government purchase of 50,000 tons (not ‘tonnes’ \\naccording to the text) from farmers and cooperatives who are still long. It is true that when the wind blows even a turkey can fly and \\nmaybe  they  are  only  flying  a  kite but  perhaps  one  of  the  questions  any old  buzzard  might  ask  – there  could  be  a  few  -  to  those \\n‘familiar with the matter’ might be their intentions for the other 150,000 tons allegedly dotted around the place or where that falls \\nwithin the plans to ‘roll’ more than 200,000 tons of unsold main crop into the mid.  After that light relief, the fun stopped abruptly \\nas one’s focus returned to a London market whose non-descript performances of late – despite a nod in the direction of yesterday’s \\nbullish candle – continued. Pale volume is often a feature which develops in these stagnant scenarios and while it is not the only \\nharbinger, when periods of low turnover extend, they can herald a sharp move for which only a few are prepared. If so, this may \\nmanifest itself by way of thrusts out of some loose triangles (no doubt rationalised by the slew of grind data that is on its way), but \\nthose of a bullish bent – surely there must be some out there – should remember that markets like to fill gaps and the ones left on \\nvarious contracts on November 14th remain open. \\n     Given the recent pace of trading a quick glance at the settlements in New York would be enough for most to just as quickly look \\naway.  Yet under the surface there were some interesting trading flows that might be worth a few minutes of attention… hopefully.  \\nFirst, prices opened firm and spent the majority of the session trading about 1% higher testing a short-term ceiling that has been in \\nplace for the last seven sessions.  While the market has endured numerous rallies and retreats, as well as the opposite oscillations, \\nthroughout this latest stretch of range bound trading, interestingly today’s reversal came in tandem with a besiege of options trading\\nthat included more than 2,300 Mar21 2800-2950 calls spreads and nearly 1,500 additional 2800 calls.  Judging solely by the uptick \\nin  implied  volatility  and the  fact  that  each  continued  to  trade  the  same  price,  8  and  10 pts  respectively,  as  prices  fell,  both  were \\npresumably initiated from the buy side…again as prices fell a decline that continued throughout the 90 minutes that transpired for \\nthose volumes to transact as well as into the post settlement hours.  Perhaps it was just coincidence, tied to the positive inflation data \\nout of the US and the generally buoyant commodity sector in which cocoa has yet to participate, but the inverse nature of the futures \\nmovements  and  options  flow  was  curious.    Structure  too  landed  at  an  interesting  spot  after  firming  in  early  dealings  with \\nMar21/May21  trading  back  to  the  low  +$40s,  an  area  that  has  been  a  support  point  over  the  last  weeks.
